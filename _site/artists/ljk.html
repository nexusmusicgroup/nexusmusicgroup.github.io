            <p class="feature"><p>Endorsed by Yamaha, PRS Guitars Europe, Orange Amplification and Boss Effects Pedals, 18 year old Leoni is a multi award winning singer-songwriter and multi instrumentalist from the UK.</p>

<p>Since beginning her musical career at the age of eleven, emerging artist Leoni Jane Kennedy has already achieved an enormous amount. She’s won multiple awards for songwriting, being crowned the UK’s number one under 19’s singer songwriter when she was just 13. The  ‘Rock the House’ 2014 award led to Leoni receiving sponsorship from industry giants Yamaha and Orange Amplification, as well as being personally invited to perform live in London’s House of Commons for industry executives. Leoni has also won multiple prestigious young performers awards where she outshone all competition to win best singer songwriter on all occasions. With hundreds of live gigs under her belt and her first live radio performance at the age of 13, this is only the beginning of her ‘one to watch’ career.</p>

<p>In September 2018, Queen’s Brian May and Roger Taylor chose Leoni from hundreds of applicants to receive a full university scholarship set up in Freddie Mercury’s memory, “The Freddie Mercury Scholarship”, to enable her to attend the Academy of Contemporary Music in Guildford free of tuition fees, stating that “Leoni’s unique and beautiful artistry was a perfect fit for Freddie’s memory”.</p>

<p>Described as haunting and mesmerising by many that see her, Leoni has her own style of playing that ranges from solo acoustic fingerpicking to lead guitar solos and rock ballads. The ability to write, sing record and produce her own material, for a solo artist, band or commercial brief, means that Leoni is a one stop shop for any requirements. A fantastic work ethic for such a young musician means that her work is highly recommended by all that know her.</p>

<p>Having sung at live shows around the UK, Leoni is regularly invited back to London to perform at The Bedford Live in Balham, London’s number one live music venue which has been pivotal in the early careers of Ed Sheeran, Paolo Nutini and KT Tunstall, to name a few. It was here at The Bedford that Leoni met veteran songwriter and performer Tony Moore, an original member of Iron Maiden as well as keyboardist with Cutting Crew ( I just Died In Your Arms Tonight) in the 80’s. Tony said, “Since meeting her when she won the ‘Rock the House’ award I have continued to follow her career and help where I can to raise her profile- Leoni has fantastic talents that belie her young age and I see enormous potential for her to have a long and successful career in this business.”</p>

<p>Tony continues to support Leoni and has become a great friend.</p>

<p>Also continually supporting Leoni is Planet Rock Radio presenter Paul Anthony, who said;
“When I judged ‘Rock The House’ Under 19’s National competition in London, this 13 year old certainly grabbed my attention and completely blew me away with her talent ! Fast forward two years and a video of Leoni covering a prog rock song by ‘Rush’ got 17,000 hits in 48 hours via Planet Rock’s website. Acoustic or electric, solo or with a band, Leoni definitely has a bright future ! “</p>
